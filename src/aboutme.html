                <p>Shalom Habtamu, born in Norway, Trondheim.</p>
                <p>Come along on a cosmic adventure with me, Shalom Habtamu, 26 years old, an astronaut whose career started in the complex field of software engineering and now extends into the fascinating realm of space travel. Equipped with an undergraduate degree in software engineering, my preliminary exploration of the realm of code and algorithms served as a basis for a journey beyond the confines of computer devices.<br> From the beginning, I was drawn to mathematics and astronomy with such enthusiasm that I could not resist the universe. I took comfort in thinking about the size of the universe and the fascinating mathematical patterns that govern the planets during the quiet moments in between lines of code. Making the bold decision to go into space and change careers from programmer to astronaut was more than just a career move. I took on challenges and used my love of journeys as fuel to follow a path that eventually brought me to NASA. My journey encompasses everything from software debugging to space exploration, it's the very definition of following one's passions without fear. <br>Floating in space, my journey echoes through the stars. From coding to stargazing, let's dream together under the endless sky. The universe is vast, and so are the dreams that guide us. In the quiet of space, my story whispers, and as the cosmic tale ends, I find peace in knowing that dreams are eternal, just like the universe.
